# Loan Repayment Predictions Analysis

## Overview

In this notebook, we'll explore loan repayment predictions using machine learning techniques. Our goal is to build a model that can predict whether a loan applicant is likely to repay the loan or default.

### Data Source

- **Dataset**: UCI Online Retail Dataset
- **Description**: Transnational data capturing loan application details.
- **Columns**: InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, Country

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
    - Read the dataset.
    - Handle missing values and data inconsistencies.

2. **Descriptive Statistics**:
    - Explore summary statistics for numeric columns (Quantity, UnitPrice).
    - Investigate the distribution of categorical columns (Country).

3. **Visualizations**:
    - Create visualizations to understand:
        - Loan approval trends over time.
        - Key features affecting loan repayment.

## Feature Engineering

1. **Feature Selection**:
    - Identify relevant features for loan repayment prediction.
    - Consider variables like credit score, income, loan amount, etc.

2. **Data Splitting**:
    - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

## Model Building

1. **Classification Models**:
    - Train various classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
    - Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
    - Optimize model hyperparameters to improve predictions.

## Results and Insights

1. **Model Evaluation**:
    - Compare model performance.
    - Identify the best-performing model.

2. **Feature Importance**:
    - Determine which features contribute most to loan repayment predictions.

## Conclusion

Predicting loan repayment is crucial for financial institutions. By analyzing historical loan data and building accurate models, we can make informed decisions and reduce default rates.
